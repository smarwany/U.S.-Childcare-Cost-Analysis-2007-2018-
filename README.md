# U.S. Childcare Cost Analysis (2007–2018)

## Overview
This project analyzes trends in U.S. childcare costs across all 50 states from 2007 to 2018. The focus is on weekly full-time median prices for both family-based childcare and center-based childcare across infants, toddlers, and preschool-aged children.

The goal of this analysis is to identify long-term cost trends, compare state-level variation, and evaluate how childcare prices have changed over time.

## Key Findings

- Childcare costs increased consistently from 2007 to 2018.
- Costs were lowest in 2007 and highest in 2017–2018.
